# Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview
This project is about analyzing Airbnb listing prices and understanding how prices change based on different factors.  
The main focus of this project is price and room type.

I used basic Python libraries to explore the data, visualize price trends, and create a simple pricing recommendation logic.

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb prices and build a simple pricing recommendation system based on room type.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains Airbnb listings from New York.
It includes details like:
- Price
- Room type
- Location
- Number of reviews
- Availability

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## Project Steps
1. Loaded the Airbnb dataset and checked its structure
2. Explored the price column and removed missing values
3. Analyzed price distribution and average price
4. Compared prices based on room type
5. Created a simple pricing recommendation logic

---

## Pricing Recommendation Logic
- Entire home listings are recommended a higher price
- Private rooms get a moderate price increase
- Shared rooms get a slightly lower price recommendation

This logic is rule-based and kept simple for better understanding.

---

## Output
- Price analysis using charts
- Average price comparison by room type
- Recommended price for each listing

---

## Limitations
This project uses a simple rule-based pricing method.
Real-world dynamic pricing would include more factors such as demand, seasonality, and customer behavior.

---

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how pricing analysis works using real data.
It also shows how simple logic can be used to make pricing recommendations.
